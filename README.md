# Kisan-Sahayak-Solar-Drone

This Projected is implemented under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyaan with an aim to provide drones for farming purposes at reasonable costs.

## Tools used

1. Size of drone 1.5 m (diagonal)
2. Arm me a carbon fiber
3. 3d printing use
4. Pesticide ka tank me sloshing effect kam karne ke hisab se design, based on, based on
5. Propeller blades material-  ABS plastic
6. 2 GPS sensor
7. Software to control and automatic
8. Pesticides nozzle on all 4 legs
9. A compressor pump is used to send liquid to the nozzle

## Why do we select 4 rotors?

=>After estimating the weight, we decided “Not to use Wing included aircrafts” because both wing and stabilizers increase unnecessary weight, leading to lesser battery life.

=>Bicopters are unstable in the Longitudinal direction i.e in the direction of the fuselage, based on this, solve this by opting for a swashplate mechanism as the control of rotors but it would complex the system. Bicopter UAVs task performance is also quite lower than that of Quadcopters and Hexacopters so we discluded the Bicopter.

=>Quadcopters are mostly used UAVs, they have better “Controllability, Power Efficiency, Maneuverability, Ease of Payload packaging”. So, we selected 4 rotors, as we increase the number of rotors the stability gets increased but at the same time maneuverability decreases. In our project, we need More maneuverability. 

## Time difference b/w manual and drone


| |Manual |Drone  |
|----- |----- |----- |
|Size of field (in acre) |1  |1  |
|Time required (in hrs)|12.3 |.16 |
|Cost per hour (is rs)|37.5 |500 |
|Total cost (in Rs)|461 |80 |

## Aerodynamic Shape:
 
### Advantages:
1. Extra lift is produced by the wing.
2. Less Drage
3. More surface area available forfeiting the panel

### Disadvantages:
1. As mentioned in Advantages, that extra lift will be produced by the wing but it is at a higher speed but in our case, the drone won’t fly at higher speeds.
2. To make a wing-like structure we have to make a tail to overcome the pitch down moment at Positive AOA. otherwise, we have to control it with  our rotors which may be tough for Farmers and require more practice.
3. The transition phase of the rotor from vertical to horizontal axis is more difficult because during this process, the net thrust vector will come, and our drone may get unstable. Proper coding and proper controls are required.
Heavyweight, so we need to produce more downward force to lift u, resulting in more power consumption.

So, According to the above advantages and disadvantages we can see for our application a simpler drone with low weight is more convenient.
